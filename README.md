# Bitmap Set
This is a C code that implements a simple bitmap set. A bitmap set is an array of bits, where each bit can be either 0 or 1. This bitmap set can be used to store a set of integers in a compact way.

The code contains the following functions:

`initializeBitmapSet`: Initializes the bitmap set to an empty set.
`setValue`: Sets the bit at the given index to 1.
`getValue`: Gets the value of the bit at the given index.
`getSize`: Returns the number of bits that are set to 1 in the bitmap set.
`unsetValue`: Sets the bit at the given index to 0.
`printBinaryValue`: Prints the binary representation of the bitmap set to the console.

The size of the bitmap set is defined by the constant BITMAP_SIZE, which is set to 32 by default. This means that the bitmap set can store up to 32 integers.

The maximum bit index is defined by the constant MAX_BIT_INDEX, which is defined as BITMAP_SIZE - 1. This means that the valid bit indices are in the range 0 to 31.

To use the bitmap set, include the "bitmap.h" header file in your C code.
